## Partition: {partition_name}

### Coverage

- **Files in partition:** {file_count}
- **Files with matches:** {files_with_matches}
- **Files without matches:** {files_without_matches} (verified no relevant code)

### Search Terms Used

- `{term1}` - {count1} matches
- `{term2}` - {count2} matches
- `{term3}` - {count3} matches

### All Matches

| File           | Line | Code Snippet         |
| -------------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| `path/file.py` | 123  | `code snippet here`  |
| `path/file.py` | 456  | `another snippet...` |

**Description:** {how this pattern works and when it's used}

#### Pattern B: {pattern_name} ({count} occurrences)

| File           | Line | Code Snippet        |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| `path/file.py` | 789  | `code snippet here` |

**Description:** {how this pattern works and when it's used}

### Inconsistencies Found

#### Inconsistency 1: {brief description}

| File       | Line | Approach                                    |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `file1.py` | 100  | {description of approach A}                 |
